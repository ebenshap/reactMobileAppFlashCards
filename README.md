# reactMobileAppFlashCards
Project set up for Udacity course in React Native

To install run `yarn install`, and I think that should be it.

I tested this out on an Android device using Expo client version 2.17.4

This is an app for testing yourself with flash cards. The home page is a list of your decks. There's tab navigation at the bottom of the page to add a new deck. Clicking on the decks listed on the home page takes the user to an individual view of the deck where you can add a card, take the quiz or delete the deck.
